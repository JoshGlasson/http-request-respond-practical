# Diagram the http request/response cycle

In order to check my understanding, I'd like to diagram how information flows when I visit a site in my browser.

My diagram should include:
- client/browser
- server
- controller
- request
- response

It should also include anything I know about different parts of this system.

This will also allow me to become better at diagramming my mental model, and communicate it with someone else.
